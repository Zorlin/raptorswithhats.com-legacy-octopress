This is a phrase I hear sometimes. "Don't say Merry Christmas".

To me it stinks of needless killjoy, of dread and bitterness.

Yes, there are many other holidays that aren't Christmas. But it's tradition to say "Merry Christmas" and it's not your right to *not* hear it. However...

Perhaps a better way to say it would be "Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays". There, wouldn't that make everyone feel better?
