Having done my Hour of Databases on Khan Academy I decided to finally start the long slog towards filling the gaps in my mathematics education.

About 30 minutes of tearing through the "Early math" section I've reached 69% completion and I have 52,111 "energy points".

Gamification is ridiculously effective, as it turns out. I'm going to aim to do 100,000 points a day, which is about an hour or so at the early levels. I suspect I'll need to lower that to 50,000 or 25,000 once I start making real progress.

Despite abusing my sleep schedule severely over the last few days, I'm still tired and wanting to go to bed at 10pm. It turns out I set that pattern pretty hard.

That's it for today :)
