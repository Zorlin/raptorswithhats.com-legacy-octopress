Really, this post should be titled *Hacking My Life: Day 2 - In Which Benjamin Does a Thing*.

Technically, it's actually Day 3 - since it's 1:20am.

Had an excellent Christmas with friends and family, so I've been busy most of the day. I did get to lug my Chromebook to and from a lunch/dinner party and was thus able to work on learning SQL - I did the "Hour of Databases" on Khan Academy.

<!-- more -->
This is what I ended up submitting for the project at the end. I'm fairly happy with it - I was amazed at the crap I forgot when I did a first pass. It'll be interesting to see how it's evaluated. KA appears to use students to eval other students, which helps scalability but probably isn't even close to 1:1.

Anyways, without further ado:
