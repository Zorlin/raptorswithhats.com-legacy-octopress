So there's something about Soylent that sucks.

No, the taste is okay, it fills you up just fine and near enough as I can tell, I won't grow a third arm from drinking/eating it.

What sucks is preparing single meals.

<!-- more -->

When you first order Soylent, you are supplied with everything you need to make either a full day of Soylent or a customizable amount.

This is great, and honestly the problems I'm about to describe aren't that easy to solve. I'm not going to be surprised if they are **never** solved, in fact. I don't blame Soylent for this one bit.

Basically, preparing meals one by one (or less or more) with the scoop is a horribly messy process and takes a lot of precision. This is sort of inherent to the fact that it's *powder-based food* and is pretty forgivable next to all the other good stuff Soylent does for me.

The other issue with it (though this one is definitely *my* fault!) is that if you don't have precise measuring teaspoons for the oil you will end up with a pretty weird mixture sometimes. I didn't use enough oil when I prepared a meal yesterday, so I ended up with a weird taste. Then, today, I decided to use slightly more to compensate for the nutrition I didn't get yesterday... and ended up with something much oilier than intended.

I think I'll stick to preparing full days from now on. It's just easier.

Unfortunately I've wasted a full day's worth as I left the big 2L container at work in the fridge.

Finally, I seem to be having issues with the sucralose in Soylent. I'm hoping eventually I'll have the option to order it without it.
