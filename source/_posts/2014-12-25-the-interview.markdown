I had the pleasure of watching "The Interview" today. I was honestly not sure if it would be any good, but I had to watch it simply to support freedom of speech.

I have a feeling this could end up being one of the most successful films ever produced because of the SPE controversy surrounding it. I'm a little worried about the possibility of Christmas Day terrorist attacks, but I also feel that it's a risk we have to take. Letting threats run our lives is not the American Way (tm).

Either way, this movie has a solid chance of becoming an essential item for the average American patriot. Eagle poster, Old Faithful bedspread, Uncle Sam coffee cup - and a Blu-Ray of The Interview.

Anyways, it was honestly a pretty excellent movie and most people would enjoy watching it. So you should.

Come on.

Do it for freedom.
