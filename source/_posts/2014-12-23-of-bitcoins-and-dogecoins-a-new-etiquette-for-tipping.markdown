Let's imagine something for a second.

In this hypothetical situation, we're close friends. I randomly come up to you and give you a coin worth 50 cents. Puzzled, you ask me why I did this - to which I reply that it's just a random present.

Even though I have given you something for free, chances are you've come away from this experience with a negative opinion of me. Either way, you probably think I'm weird.

Let's expand the hypothetical now. 

Let's pretend this is a coin that you cannot easily convert into USD - doing so would require going to your bank and handing them your social security number and driver's license. It's also got some magical properties - you can push it into your monitor and it will travel across the internet to wherever you would like it to.

You cannot spend this money at almost any brick-and-mortar store, but there *are* stores online that will accept it.

Here is the question: what is the minimum amount of money this coin would have to be worth in order for you to be happy to receive it?

In my opinion, an opinion that is apparently shared by most others I've asked, that number is this: **$5**.

Why $5? It's just enough money to buy something cool and it still creates enough of a challenge that it's sort of fun looking for things to buy with it. It's also just enough to be considered a serious amount by people.

You've probably figured out by now that the magical coin I'm referring to represents (most) modern cryptocurrency. Most cryptocurrencies have bots that allow you to "tip" other people small or large amounts of cryptocurrency, which is ridiculously awesome and fun. It spreads good-will and it's an interesting way to spread the word about digital currencies. Unfortunately, there's a flaw with how this is currently happening.

People are tipping small amounts to people that have nothing to do with cryptocurrency - anywhere from 0.05&cent; to 50&cent;. This isn't a problem within the cryptocurrency community - lots of people tip there, so chances are you will eventually accumulate enough to buy something. Even if you don't, tipping is fun and makes people happy within that community.
