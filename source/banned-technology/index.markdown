So I've come to the conclusion that there are some technologies I simply shouldn't allow myself to touch when I'm not at work. Here is the list, sure to grow...

* CephFS - the eater of time.
* OpenVPN - bringer of tears.
* SAMBA4 - dear god, no.
* CoreOS - too cool for my own good.
* Sympa - not that I'd want to.
* OpenStack - pretty self-explanatory.
